# MinesPuzzle
Minesweeper clone, current latest project Dec21.

A homestudy classroom project, and skills show piece.

The finished C# code seems to be fairly polished to me.  
The first iteration mostly used a click and return chain.

Likely improvements?
The XAML, Styles & a TileButton derivative, Options & Best Times, Animations for fading in and out, ToolTips,
and a TopCenter box for a graphic.

As I might stay unemployed and interested in this project.
